ruby-1.9.3p545
==============

Base Ruby 1.9.3p545 container for octohost.

To use an already built container:

`docker pull octohost/ruby-1.9.3p545`

Or you can build it from this source:

`docker build -t your-organization/ruby-1.9.3p545`

NOTE: You can always get the most current ruby 1.9 container this way:

`docker pull octohost/ruby-1.9`
